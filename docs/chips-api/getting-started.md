# Getting Started with the Wokwi Custom Chips C API

:::warning

The Chips API is currently in beta. Please share your experiments and provide feedback in the `#custom-chips` channel on the [Discord chat](https://wokwi.com/discord).

:::

## Introduction

The Custom Chips API allows you to create new simulation models and extend the functionality of Wokwi. You can create new sensors, displays, memories, testing instruments, and even simulate your own custom hardware.

Custom Chips are usually written in C, but you can use any language that compiles to WebAssembly (e.g. Rust, AssemblyScript, etc.). There is also an experimental support for writing custom chips in Verilog.

## Getting started

Open any Wokwi project (or [create a new one](https://wokwi.com/projects/new)) and click on the blue "+" button in the diagram editor. Select "Custom Chip" from the list of options.

You'll see a dialog where you can enter the chip name, as well as the language you wish to use. We recommend using C for now. After typing a name for your chip, click on the "Create Chip" button.

This will add a copy of the chip to your diagram and create two files in your project:

- a [JSON file](./chip-json) with the chip pinout and settings (name, author, etc.)
- a C file with the chip code (or a rust/verilog file, depending on the language you selected).

The [JSON file](./chip-json) file defines a minimal set of pins ("VCC", "GND", "IN", "OUT"). Change the pin names and add more pins as needed.

The C file contains a minimal chip implementation. Add your code to the `chip_init()` function. This function is called for every instance of the chip in the diagram. You can use it to initialize the chip state, configure timers, and set up pin watches.

The example code also includes a `chip_state_t` struct, where you can store any state that your chip needs. You can use the `user_data` field of the `i2c_config_t`, `timer_config_t`, etc. to store a pointer to this struct.

### Debugging your custom chip

You can print debugging messages using the standard C `printf()` function. Make sure to also `#include <stdio.h>` in your program. The debug messages will appear in a new "Chips Console" tab below the diagram view:

<img src={ChipsConsoleImage} alt="Chips Console" width="543" height="109" />

In addition, you can use the [Wokwi Logic Analyzer](../guides/logic-analyzer) to debug the communication with your custom chip.

:::tip
Make sure to include a newline ("\n") at the end of your `printf()` messages. The simulator shows the messages only when it reaches a newline character.

## Packaged custom chips, at Github repositories

Once you consider your custom chip stable enough, you can package it and publish it as a separate Github repository, with releases. WokWi is able to fetch the releases from Github and include them into other designs. Each release must include a `chip.zip` file containing exactly one `chip.json` and one `chip.wasm` file, describing the chip. For more information, see [Packaged Chips](./packaged-chip) or see the [Inverter chip example](https://github.com/wokwi/inverter-chip/releases) in Github.

To use such a packaged custom chip in your design, use the [`"dependencies"` tag in your `diagram.json`](/diagram-format#connections) file.

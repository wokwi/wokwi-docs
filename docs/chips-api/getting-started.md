# Getting Started with the Wokwi Custom Chips C API

:::caution

This is a very early stage prototype. Please share your experiments and provide feedback in the `#custom-chips` channel on the [Discord chat](https://wokwi.com/discord).

:::

## Getting started

Open the [Custom Chip Playground](https://wokwi.com/projects/327144279206003284), go to the code editor, press `F1` and select _Create a custom C chip (alpha)_.

This will create a new file called `i2c-counter.chip.c`. This file contains an example of a simple [I2C](i2c) device with an 8-bit counter that increments for every byte that you read. Writing to the device will override the value.

The device also provides an `INT` pin that goes low when the counter is greater than `127`. Otherwise, the `INT` pin is in input (high impedance) state.

Start the simulation to observe the behavior of the custom chip: the Arduino code should read the counter value, and the LED will light up when the counter goes over `127`.

## Adding your custom chip to the simulation

The [Custom Chip Playground](https://wokwi.com/projects/327144279206003284) already has the chip wired in, but you can follow the instructions below to connect a custom chip to a different project.

Add the following snippet to your diagram.json:

`{ "type": "chip-i2c-counter", "id": "chip1", "top": 0, "left": 0, "attrs": {} },`

Wokwi automatically generates a **breakout board** for your chip. Edit `i2c-counter.chip.json` to define the pins for your part. The `pins` array should contain the names of your chip's pins, starting from pin number `1`. If you wish to skip some pins (e.g. you want the breakout board to only have pins on its left side), use an empty string (`""`) for the pin name.

## Using the API

First, make sure to `#include "wokwi-api.h"`.
The chip should declare a `chip_init` method. This method will be called for every new instance of the chip. If the chip has some internal state, `chip_init` should allocate memory for the internal state, and save a pointer to this memory in the `void *user_data` field of the device configuration structures (e.g. `i2c_config_t`, `timer_config_t`, etc.).

Here's an example of a minimal chip file:

```cpp
#include "wokwi-api.h"

void chip_init() {
  /*
    This method runs when the simulation starts. It's called once for each instance of the chip.
    You'd usually allocate some memory to store the chip state, initialize a bunch of pins with pin_init(),
    and configure pin watches, timers, and protocols such as UART, I2C, and SPI.
  */
}
```

### Debugging your custom chip

You can print debugging messages using the standard C `printf()` function. Make sure to also `#include <stdio.h>` in your program. The debugging messages will appear in the browser's developer console (to view it in Chrome: `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`J` or `Option`+`âŒ˜`+`J`).

The debug messages from your chip will be printed in green color:

<img src={require('./chip-debug.png').default} alt="Chip debug messages displayed in green" />

In addition, you can use the [Wokwi Logic Analyzer](../guides/logic-analyzer) to debug the communication with your custom chip.

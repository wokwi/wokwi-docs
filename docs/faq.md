## What does Wokwi mean?

When choosing the name for Wokwi, we were looking for a short word that would be easy to pronounce and didn't have any meaning yet. We came up with a list of possible names, and picked up the one we liked the most, Wokwi. Here are some of the names that didn't make it: Duvav, Hajuu, Chipine, Zeprr.

## How do I find a project I saved previously?

If you haven't signed in to Wokwi, use the same device & browser that saved the project and visit [https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects](https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects). If you sign in to Wokwi before saving projects, that same URL will show all projects that you have saved on any device/browser.  You can also navigate to your saved projects by clicking on your profile picture and selecting "My Projects" from the menu.

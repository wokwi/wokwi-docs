## What does Wokwi mean?

When choosing the name for Wokwi, we were looking for a short word that would be easy to pronounce and didn't have any meaning yet. We came up with a list of possible names, and picked the one we liked the most, Wokwi. Here are some of the names that didn't make it: Duvav, Hajuu, Chipine, Zeprr.

## How do I find a project I saved previously?

If you haven't signed in to Wokwi, use the same device & browser that saved the project and visit [https://wokwi.com/dashboard/projects](https://wokwi.com/dashboard/projects). If you sign in to Wokwi before saving projects, that same URL will show all projects that you have saved on any device/browser. You can also navigate to your saved projects by clicking on your profile picture and selecting "My Projects" from the menu.

## How do I change or cancel my subscription?

You can manage your subscription, including updating or canceling it, by visiting the [Subscriptions page](https://wokwi.com/dashboard/subscriptions).

## The simulation is slow, how can I make it faster?

There are many factors that can affect the simulation speed. Here are some tips that can help you get better performance:

- Chrome is usually faster than Firefox.
- For ESP32 / Pi Pico code, adding a `delay(10);` call at the beginning of `loop()` can help, as the simulator will have less work to do while the microcontroller is sleeping.

## How can I use Wokwi offline?

Wokwi offers an offline mode through the Wokwi for VS Code extension. To set it up and learn more, visit the official guide here: [Wokwi Offline Mode Documentation](https://docs.wokwi.com/vscode/offline-mode).

## How does Wokwi work?

Wokwi compiles your code into a binary firmware, and then executes the binary firmware one instruction at a time, as a real microcontroller would. If you want to learn about the internals, check out the following resources:

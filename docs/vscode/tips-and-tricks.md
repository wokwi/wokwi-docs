## Privacy mode

By default, the simulator toolbar displays your name. If you are streaming or presenting and want to hide your personal information (name and email), you can enable privacy mode:

- Press `F1` and select "**Wokwi: Toggle Privacy Mode**", or
- Set `wokwi.hidePersonalInfo` to `true` in your VS Code settings.

Restart the simulation after changing this setting to apply it.

The CLI allows you to run Wokwi simulations from your terminal, and integrate them with your CI system. We recommend using the [Wokwi for VS Code](../vscode/getting-started) extension for local development, and the CLI for running your tests on CI.

Both the CLI and the VS Code extension use the same project configuration files ([wokwi.toml](../vscode/project-config) and [diagram.json](../diagram-format)), so you can use the VS Code extension to create and test your project, and then use the CLI to run it on CI.

To install the Wokwi CLI, run the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://wokwi.com/ci/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows, you can use the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
iwr https://wokwi.com/ci/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

Alternatively, you can download the CLI directly from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-cli/releases/latest). Rename the file to `wokwi-cli` (or `wokwi-cli.exe` on Windows), make it executable (`chmod +x wokwi-cli` on Linux/Mac), and move it to a directory in your PATH (e.g. `/usr/local/bin` on Linux/Mac).

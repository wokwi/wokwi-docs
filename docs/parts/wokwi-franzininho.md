## About the Franzininho

The Franzininho DIY in an open-source, Arduino-compatible board designed in Brazil. It's based
on the ATtiny85 chip, so please consult the [ATtiny85 documentation](wokwi-attiny85) for technical
information.

The yellow LED (LED1) is connected to pin PB1 of the ATtiny85 chip. You can learn more about
the board and the people behind it in the [Franzininho homepage](https://franzininho.com.br/) (Portuguese).

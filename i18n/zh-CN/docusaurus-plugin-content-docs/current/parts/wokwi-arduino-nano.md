The Arduino Nano is very similar to the [Arduino Uno](wokwi-arduino-uno), but in a smaller form factor. It carries the same ATmega328p chip, which has 32K bytes of Flash program memory, 2k bytes of SRAM and 1K bytes of EEPROM.

## Differences from the Arduino Uno

The Arduino Nano includes two extra analog pins: A6 and A7. These pins can only be used for Analog input. They can't be used as digital GPIO pins.
